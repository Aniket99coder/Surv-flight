  - `module2.py`: Another script for different functionality.
  - `...`: Additional scripts and modules as needed.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage and experimental analyses.
  - `notebook1.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating specific functionality.
  - `notebook2.ipynb`: Another notebook for different experiments or demonstrations.
  - `...`: More notebooks as required.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the Python modules.
  - `test_module1.py`: Tests for `module1.py`.
  - `test_module2.py`: Tests for `module2.py`.
